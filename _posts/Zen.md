This post will explain how come this webpage.

## Create webpage from scratch?

I have always been wanting to have my own webpage to record my life progress
and to share some of science-related stuffs that I am interested in to other.
However, I have almost no skills to create a website, so I thought I would not have it until the next 5 or 10 years.


## As an assigned task
{:data-toc-text="Being assigned!"}

In 2023, I joined a competition called BIOMOD with Team Sendai of Tohoku University. One part of the project is to create the webpage for posting all project-related stuffs.

### BIOMOD

[BIOMOD](http://biomod.net/) is an annual biomolecular design competition for undergraduate students. DNA, RNA, proteins, and other biomolecules can be used as building blocks to create interesting system such as robots.
