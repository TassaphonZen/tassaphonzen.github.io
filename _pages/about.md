A chemistry undergraduate student of Tohoku University, Japan who has strong enthusiasm in science especially quantum materials.

This webpage has been created to record my experiences and achievements, and to give an overview of 'who am I' to anyone who would like to know me more. This site is still under editing. I apologize for that. However, I will try my best to keep on updating this site.

Feel free to reach me out and let's get in touch!!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
